Use node in your command line to view the contents. This Web Scraper uses Axios Package to fetch the Name and URL of articles from any website specified in "app.js".

This web scraper currently just logs the result in console instead of dynamically updating or posting it to an HTML page. More to come.

Tech used: JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS and Axios.
